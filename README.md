## Why Perform Testing?  
Testing is essential for:  
- Identifying and fixing bugs early.  
- Ensuring your app meets user expectations.  
- Maintaining code quality and reducing crashes.  
- Saving time and resources by preventing issues in production.  
- Simplifying maintenance and updates.

## Types of Testing  
Flutter supports three main types of testing:  
1. **Unit Testing**: Tests individual functions or classes.  
2. **Widget Testing**: Validates widgets' UI and interactions.  
3. **Integration Testing**: Verifies end-to-end workflows.

  return a + b;  
}
